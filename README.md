# optimal-control-project

This project demonstrates optimal control strategies for stabilizing a 2DOF inverted pendulum, including Model Predictive Control (MPC) for robustness against noise.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
https://github.com/TarekAbouChakra/optimal-control-project.git
cd optimal-control-project
```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main script to execute the control strategies:

1. **Open-Loop Control**:
```bash
python scripts/projectOpenLoop_Final.py 
```

2. **Closed-Loop Control**:
```bash
python scripts/projectMPC_Final.py 
```

## Results

GIFs and images showcasing the results will be saved in the `results` folder.

## Notes

The default parameters used in the simulations are documented in the project's PDF report and can also be found in the code.
